@REM This script opens the AddaxAI program and allows for shortcut creation and execution from within Timelapse.
@REM Timelapse can also open it by executing the python command directly, but it is still here so that it mimics 
@REM the old method. In the old method we needed this batch script to perform some conda operations before opening
@REM the python script. With the Jan 2025 install update that is not neccesary anymore. But this script is still 
@REM here so that Timelapse can run the same command as before and users don't have to update their Timelapse 
@REM version when using a new AddaxAI version.
